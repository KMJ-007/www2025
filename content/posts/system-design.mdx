When designing distributed systems, one of the first considerations should be the CAP theorem trade-offs.

## What is CAP Theorem?

The CAP theorem states that a distributed system can only provide two of the following three guarantees:

- **Consistency**: Every read receives the most recent write
- **Availability**: Every request receives a response
- **Partition tolerance**: The system continues to operate despite network failures

## Real-world Examples

```js
// Example of eventual consistency in a distributed cache
const cache = new DistributedCache({
  consistency: "eventual",
  replicas: 3
});

await cache.set("key", "value");
// Value might not be immediately available on all replicas
```

## Key Takeaways

1. Choose your trade-offs based on business requirements
2. Consider the specific needs of your application
3. Don't blindly follow what others are doing
