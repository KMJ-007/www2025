## Stuff I Consume/Reference a Lot

>I am still updating this!

I find myself going into a lot of random rabbit holes, reading things, exploring things, which has affected how I think about the world and how I see things. My worldview keeps evolving - it's like collecting different models/lenses to look at and understand things around me.

I don't limit myself to what I studied or was told to study. I find myself exploring things from lots of diverse areas - from architecture to religions to biology to physics to psychology to philosophy to history to science to art to music to literature, etc. So this is my list of things I find interesting and reference a lot.

### Anime/Shows:
I am not that big of a fan of anime, I don't like new ones that much, I like old ones which are good and have good story and characters:
- Neon Genesis Evangelion
- Code Geass
- Serial Experiments Lain
- Ajin

Recently I watched Dr. Stone, and I enjoyed it!

Special mention:
>Star Trek
It changed my view of the world, and how I see things, and how I see myself and others, all the questions which I was asking, it's like seeing multiple alternative realities, what would it be like if humans were 100% rational, how societies work and emerge, and lot of other things, and yes, holodeck is the best thing ever.

Most times I just let the algorithm decide what's next, YouTube radio feature is the best.

### Architecture:
I get frustrated when I see cubical buildings around me everywhere, like we are all just cogs in the machine, and I don't like it. They may be functional and efficient, but they suck.

[here's the rant](https://x.com/KaranJanthe/status/1861744805560435195)

I really admire and like the architects and people who go against the norm and build something beautiful which they are proud of.
